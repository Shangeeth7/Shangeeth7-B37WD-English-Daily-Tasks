Q.1 -- Write a blog on difference between Document and Window Objects :

The document and window object are two of the parent objects that we can access with JavaScript.
The document object itself is subordinate to the window object.

The Window Object :
This is a Global object, which has several objects, attributes and functions within it.
It can be described as an object with a lot of meta data and data about your webpage.
It also contains the Document Object which is popularly used.


The Document Object:
The Document Object is another global object which contains the attributes, objects, 
and functions of the website but of course lesser information than the window object as it is a subset of it.
You can access the complete information and elements of the DOM from this document object.
To be precise, you can access each and every element of the page 
with a lot of functionality attached to it like methods, attributes, values, etc.,
